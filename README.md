# score-tracker-app

I created this simple application for several reasons.
1. To practice my fullstack/backend development and learn ExpressJS
2. To improve my frontend and Angular skills.
3. My friend made a score tracker app as a joke to flaunt how many times he beat me(and others at Magic: The Gathering (a card game)), sooooo I had to oneup him and make a better score tracker app.
4. Make a score tracker app, where I could change the scores in the database so that I'm winning.
5. Keep track of how many times I beat(lost to) my friend at Magic: The Gathering.
